<h1> Three Types of Golden Retrievers </h1>
<ul> 
<li> <strong> American Golden Retriever </strong> </li> 
<ol>
<li> The American stands out for being the most friendly and iconic type of Golden Retriever. </li>
<li> This type of Golden is typically smaller than the others. They have lankier and less muscular bodies compared to the other two. </li>
<li> The American Golden Retriever has a much darker colored coat compared to the English and Canadian Goldens. </li> 
<li> The American has a very specific gait that appears much more smooth and powerful than most dogs. </li> 
<li> The most apparent factor is their eyes, which are triangular shaped. Their head should not have any prominent features such as a large forehead or sunken eyes. </li> 
<li> Their hindquarters are the most muscular part of them and they have a pelvic bone that sits at a 30-degree angle. </li> 
</ol>  
</li>
<li> <strong> English Golden Retriever </strong> </li> 
<ol> 
<li> The English Golden Retrievers were first bred in Scotland and are also known as English Cream Golden Retrievers or British Golden Retrievers </li> 
<li> They are most similar to American Golden Retriever, but there are a few main physical differences </li> 
<li> They have a broad skull and chiseled mussel. These things are due to their original breeding being done with the Tweed Water Spaniel. </li> 
<li> They have the lightest coat out of all three types of Goldens. </li> 
<li> English Golden Retrievers have round eye shapes and darker eye colors. </li> 
</ol>
</li> 
<li> <strong> Canadian Golden Retriever </strong> </li> 
<ol> 
<li> They were originally bred in Canada.</li> 
<li> The hair length on the Canadian Golden Retriever is usually much shorter, thinner, and denser, than the other two. </li> 
<li> The Canadian Golden Retriever is the tallest type of Golden, standing as many as 2 inches taller. </li> 
</ol>
