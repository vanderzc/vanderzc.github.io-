<h1> All About Golden Retrievers </h1>
<p> The golden retriever is one of the most beloved dogs, earning smiles wherever it goes. Goldens are medium sized dogs that are famous for their luscious golden coat of fur, earning the dog its name. They have broad heads and short ears. These dogs tend to move very powerfully and have light feathery tails. This dog breed is known for being outgoing, eager to please, and fairly easy to train. Golden Retrievers tend to carry their playful puppy like behavior well into adulthood. They are naturally great at activities such as swimming and fetching. </p>
<p> The average male golden retriever will stand at 23-24 inches tall and weight 65-75 lbs. The average female golden retriever will stand at 21.5-22.5 inches tall and weight 55-65 lbs. The average life expectancy for all goldens is about 10-12 years old. Goldens tend to heavily shed their water repellant coat of fur about once or twice a year and between that they continuously shed moderately. It is recommended to brush them once or twice a week in order to control the shedding. Goldens require regular nail trimmings. </p>
<p> Golden Retrievers require a lot of daily exercise, otherwise they can become mal-behaved. It is recommended to consult a vet prior to doing any strenuous exercise with them however, as high impact exercise can put unhealthy stress on their bones.  Overall, golden retrievers are healthy dogs, though they should be screened primarily for elbow and hip dysplasia and certain heart diseases. Additionally, their ears should be checked weekly for infection and they should receive often teeth brushings. All of these things are important to make sure these wonderful dogs are sufficiently taken care of and remain loved members of the family. </p>
